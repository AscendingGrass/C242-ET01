# C242-ET01
This repository contains code and resources for fine-tuning and testing AI models for this project, including two Colab Notebooks and a dataset.

## Repository Structure
Our repository is organized into the following directories & files:

* `dataset`: This directory contains the dataset used in this project.
* `results`: This directory contains the test results of our models and other openly available models on our test set.
* `C242_ET01_Llama_3_1_8b_+_Unsloth_2x_faster_finetuning.ipynb`: This is a Colab Notebook that contains our fine-tuning code. The train set can be found in the `dataset` directory.
* `C242_ET01_Benchmark.ipynb`: This is a Colab Notebook for testing our models. The results can be found in the `results` directory and the test set can be found in the `dataset` directory.

## Models
Our finetuned models are available here:
* [Llama-3.2_3B_C242-ET01](https://huggingface.co/AscendingGrass/Llama-3.2_3B_C242-ET01)
* [Llama-3.1_8B_C242-ET01](https://huggingface.co/AscendingGrass/Llama-3.1_8B_C242-ET01)

The 4bit GGUF version of those models are available here:
